# About

A website that offers classical operations on matrices.

## What I learned so far:
- CommonJS vs ES modules.
- Use Babel to compile ESM to CJM.
- Install and configure Jest.
- A taste of TDD.

### Done:
- Calculate determinant

### To do:
- Addition/subtraction
- Multiplication/division
- Find better names for variables/functions etc. it's a mess
- Remember previous session's selection
- Random matrix generator
- Interpret and read "," keystroke as "."

#### Bugs to fix:
- Not accepting negative numbers (not matching "-")
